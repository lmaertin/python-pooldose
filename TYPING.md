# Type Checking Status

## PEP-561 Compliance

**PEP-561 Compliant**: The package includes a `py.typed` file marking it as typed.
**Public API Typed**: Core public API methods have type annotations.
**mypy Configuration**: Includes mypy configuration in pyproject.toml.

## Current Type Coverage

### Fully Typed Modules
- `pooldose.__init__` - Package initialization with version
- `pooldose.request_status` - Enum for request status codes
- `pooldose.constants` - Device constants and mappings

### Partially Typed Modules  
- `pooldose.client` - Main client class (public API fully typed)
- `pooldose.values.static_values` - Static device information
- `pooldose.values.instant_values` - Live sensor data (public methods typed)

### Internal Modules
- `pooldose.request_handler` - HTTP request handling (internal)
- `pooldose.mappings.mapping_info` - Device mapping logic (internal)
- `pooldose.mock_client` - Testing mock client (internal)

## Home Assistant Integration

This package is designed for use in Home Assistant integrations with the following guarantees:

1. **Public API Type Safety**: All user-facing methods have proper type annotations
2. **PEP-561 Compliance**: Package is marked as typed for external type checkers
3. **Core Functionality**: Essential types (RequestStatus, Client methods) are fully typed
4. **Import Safety**: All imports are type-safe for integration developers

## Usage in Home Assistant

```python
from pooldose import PooldoseClient
from pooldose.request_status import RequestStatus

# Type checker will properly infer types
client: PooldoseClient = PooldoseClient("192.168.1.100")
status: RequestStatus = await client.connect()
```

## Known Limitations

- Some internal modules have relaxed typing for development flexibility
- Complex generic types in mapping systems use Any for compatibility
- Mock client uses runtime typing for JSON-based testing

## Quality Assurance

- Pylint: 10.00/10 score maintained
- Core API: Type-safe imports and usage
- PEP-561: Proper typing metadata included
- Internal modules: Partially typed for maintainability
